## Game Mechanics

### Core Gameplay
- Snake moves with arrow keys, grows after eating food
- Score increases based on fruit type (Apple: 10, Banana: 15, Orange: 20, Strawberry: 25)
- Game over occurs when snake hits wall without luck feature
- High score persists between sessions
- Space key: pause/unpause during gameplay, restart after game over
- Game starts with space key or any arrow key from initial screen (after interaction)

### Collision Mechanics
- L key toggles luck feature (auto-avoids collisions 80% of the time when enabled)
- Snake cuts tail on self-collision 50% of time with score reduction
- Visual feedback and sound effect play when luck or tail-cutting activates

### Speed Dynamics
